# ADVANCED STATISTICS for the TI-92

This program aims to create the statistics functions that were added in the TI-92 Plus in a manner that is relatively graphical and usable. There is built-in stats functionality in the TI-92, but they are incredibly limited, notably not allowing for expected mean calculations.
This program is still a work-in-progress project, so don't expect perfection. I will upload major releases to ticalc.org as I work on it.
Thanks for trying out my pet project (and for having some patience during the development)!
